        <p>Immediately turning on your heel and heading to the door, you were hoping to risk only what was necessary to escape. This seemed self-explanatory. The flames were in the room, and sure, they were in the doorway too...but outside it was fine. You just had to brace it for long enough.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You had already managed to deal with lost limbs and breathing underwater already. Things didn't make sense there, surely this would turn out similarly. You wouldn't be nearly as daring if not for the fact this was in a parallel dreamscape to all the other happenings tonight. Ideally, you walk through the fire, considering the logic you've come to gain through your previous experiences. Generally unscathed, maybe a bit perplexed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You heard the ceiling start to fall as loose rubble behind you. Now or never, you committed to leaping towards and through the doorway. What happened next could only be described as part of what you would have to trademark as your typical, bewildering dreamscape.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Heat became more than what you felt, but it became what you were. It was not something you were in, but something you succumbed to and became a part of. Your body now served as pieces of flames instead of existing on a solid plane. You were freely formed, and freer with each new crackle.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>With each crackle came a new ounce of relief from stress buildup. However, in the next few passing moments, you could feel yourself returning to a solid and sandy-like form. Ashes rested on the floor, your ashes, until you tried to will yourself to move.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The flames and ashes you possessed swirled with one another. You felt a step happening before seeing it for yourself. A foot formed on the floor, the flames burning away until your skin took place of the ash. Taking a step with your other to-be foot did much the same thing. Legs built up from those, and upwards still. A few steps down the clear hallway, and you knew you successfully made it to the other side.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When you took a breath, you felt renewed. Things were crisper and smoother than they had been before. You felt as free and easy-moving as you had when you were little more than fire. When you tried looking back from where you came, there was only a closed door with no signs of the burning going on inside.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Your attention returned to what was in front of you, no more thoughts given to what remained behind. Approaching another door, you didn't hesitate in opening it to the stunning outdoors. It was so calm and so peaceful. It even made you excited for what more was ahead.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The sights all around you faded away within the next few minutes of you marvelling them. Once again, you were between your content sleep state and awaking from it.</p>
