        <p>What was that dream? You didn't know if you preferred that over not sleeping. In theory, you should, since it meant you were getting rest. Actual, genuine rest that could return things the way they ideally should be. The reason was there, but the refuge was not. Regardless of the amount of time you had gotten in comparison to near none, you somehow felt worse off. The peculiarity was almost sickening. And the more you thought about it, the more you could feel your tiredness slipping away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But this...this was progress! It meant that you may not have to go in to the doctor's after all if you could finally get around to sleeping on your own. Dreams so odd couldn't happen all the time, right? What were the point of dreams if all they did was make you want to wake up? The craziness would dim down, there'd be sufficiently less to worry about, and then you could sleep through the whole night.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For now, this would suffice. It would have to. Anyone watching would know that there was no hope for anything else. Particularly not for falling back asleep tonight. There was about four hours left until your alarm would go off. Four hours until you'd be getting ready for another day at work, where you would be wishing on all of your lucky stars that everything would go stellar. There would be no questioning glances from people at work as to whether or not you were okay. You would be thriving and rocking every minute of it. Maybe there would be impressed stares instead! You were starting to get your life together.</p>

        <p>Or at least, that's how you hoped it would appear. You sincerely doubted that anyone had their life so well-put, but a lot of people you worked with could fool you from what you saw from them. Maybe it's just because you only saw them then and there, though.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You weren't too involved with anyone there. It was a job you had applied for based on your interests, and you managed to successfully obtain it through a few rounds of interviews. You liked the general feel for the place, and the people were sincere. And, of course, you got enough to pay the bills and keep yourself fed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Sleep simply had to be more friendly to you. Tonight had been the first step in the right direction, so you should follow the same steps for the next few nights. You had already written down the time for documentation and future comparisons. Now...</p>
