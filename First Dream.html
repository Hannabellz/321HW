    <p>A shroud of darkness swept away to reveal a blinding light. It veered straight towards you and through you, making your insides flutter and pound. You felt no pain, but you did feel sick and overwhelmed. You were shaken by what you assumed to be a train paying absolutely no heed nor remorse to your well-being. You were left cold and alone.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>And apparently left to pick up your pieces, as it took looking around for the severity of the situation to register. Your left hand was about fifty feet away, your right leg even further. Luckily there was nothing that you couldn’t stomach about that—there was no blood and still no pain. In fact, even though you only had one leg, you were able to move as if you were walking with both. You thought you’d have to face looking ridiculous while hopping for so far, but that wasn’t the case at all. As far as you could tell, you were fine.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When you reached your hand and crouched to pick it up, it turned to ash. Sweeping up your leg and wrapping around your stomach, it gave a squeeze that would have been too unbearable had it been prolonged for more than a second. But it was quick to move down your arm and reconnect at your wrist, becoming a hand once again.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Instead of snapping awake and being instantly hyperaware, you drifted into an in between state. You knew you were awake, but you could...actually feel yourself being capable of going right back to sleep. In the distance you can see a somewhat blurry alarm clock that looks to read 2:23. Do you</p>
