        <p>Darkness clouded you, clothing you in shades so dark, you knew that you would've only absorbed and robbed any light that could've dared to approach. Walking, you could see objects. Desks of old schools, metal chairs that grate against your ears when they slid on the floor. The reminiscience was enough to encourage your hands to your ears. However, you felt claws where your nails should be, sharpened to a point that couldn't have happened naturally.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But...neither could any of this, right?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You kept going, blank picture frames forming before your very eyes. They weren't even filled with stock photos. Everything was blank and on its own. It was up to you to fill them, it seemed. Similarly to the sound of the chairs occurring when you though about it, as you reached and held a frame, a sight burned into your retinas. There could exist nothing around you, but there could be something that managed as a piece of you.</p>
