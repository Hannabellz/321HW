        <p>You couldn't tell how long your newfound power could last. Or if you were just in shock- but you went straight up. (Rather, what you could perceive to be up). But you felt like you had to make the most of the time you had and count on yourself. You couldn't recall the last time you'd been able to do that...Trusting yourself for judgment calls was questionable at best. Doubt kept you aware. Why let your guard down in this water- why behave differently now?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Because you were dreaming?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But...this also felt very real. You felt the tiredness of swimming, of pushing through each new wave of H20. You felt the sting against your eyes and the soaking of your hair. You felt your clothes cling to you like a lifeline that they needed to get out unscathed. Your clothes held the fear that you usually did, but presently did not.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The bountiful amounts of oxygen you had been expelling lifted you with them on the way up. Some brushed past you like they were in a greater hurry to get out. The hustle and bustle of having places to be. You were glad they were even lighter than you, for you could've been pushed who knew where otherwise?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some treated it like a race. Others were careless, brushing and shoving by you like you were an obstacle that they'd get by. Any means necessary. What was hard to get a grasp on was the vast amount of space they could be utilizing when instead they crowded you. Perhaps it was difficult for them to escape their molecular comrades otherwise. Maybe they didn't want to touch the water more directly than they already had to. Perhaps they were afraid of conforming and being stuck there.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Contemplating the thoughts of oxygen made you question if you really were asleep. This sounded like some sleepless rant that came without rhyme or reason, but could make sense only in such a mindset. They couldn't possibly be in a hurry, they couldn't possibly think, and you were growing concerned over what was realistically nothing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But, if we're talking realistically...they were the reason you could breathe when you were awake. It was good to give them credit, and it couldn't hurt to give it thought. Right?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You certainly hoped so. When your fingertips finally poked through the surface and reached a feeling of open emptiness, you excitedly made the final kicks and gasped for clear, safe breath.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>That would serve also how you woke up. A desperate call for a breath, and parts of your skin damp with sweat, as if you would've just ran a marathon. Your clock now read 3:45.</p>
