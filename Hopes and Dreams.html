        <p>They say a dream come true is worth the hardwork. It's what you were holding out to be true. The idea of going somewhere purely based on your interest and that alone was thrilling. You had set aside savings purely in hopes of making it there someday. To see the sights you knew pictures couldn't do justice for, to hear sounds that you couldn't imagine on your own. It was enticing, and perhaps even too much of a tease. But you kept the hope alive that you could and would make it there.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You hadn't thought about all of what that would mean, yet. How long would you stay there? Would it be all you wanted it to be and more? Would you want to come back? Or were your expectations all too high, and you were ultimately setting yourself up for disaster?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>That's what you were afraid of other people thinking of you. That you were too much of a dreamer. Hopeless and a bit crazy to think that you could reach your stars and count them too. For a while, you didn't care. You were set on making this goal for yourself and taking the deep dive into it. You were committed, and why let anyone stop you from being happy in such a harmless way?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But more time passed, and the tiresome stares didn't. They stopped seeing you as whimsical, and leaned more towards the crazy idea instead. They claimed they didn't want you to set yourself up for a big let-down. And maybe...maybe a part of you started to believe them.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Inklings of doubt turned into painful pressure points. You still had so much time left to do what you wanted, but was that really enough? Were they all going to be proven right, despite every ounce of effort you put in? And what would they say, then? Would they be sympathetic, or look at you like you were just pathetic?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Why...Why did you start caring what they thought of you, here? Why let them take the reigns of your dreams and turn them into nightmarish folly? Was it really so bad to dream?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The image in your eyes expanded outward around you. You were there, in the setting of the picture. And even now, you knew your dreams couldn't possibly do it justice either.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>No more darkness clouded you. Only the light and beautiful sights.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You'd get here. You knew you could.</p>
