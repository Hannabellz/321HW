        <p>Wanting to make sure you were set for later and weren't rushing to put anything together, you put on your slippers and made way to your kitchen.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was something inexplicably relaxing about how you could prepare your meals with sufficient time to not have to rush a thing. When you were able to get into a steady rhythm- which could come as second nature to you- it allowed you to access sincere tranquility. It's what you believed that meditation could do for some people.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You were in your own little space where no one else could invade, especially uninvited. It was your zone where you didn't have to think to smile. Happiness was simply an effect, and it was something that could linger even after you were through.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You took out the fruit, ice, and cinnamon rolls to get your breakfast ready first. Typically when making smoothies, you'd make enough for at least the next few days. Smoothies were never the meal by themselves, so you'd have one in a smaller cup to have along with whatever selected food for the morning. And because you felt that your feat in sleep called for a celebration, you broke out the cinnamon rolls to put in the oven. Reheating them later and drizzling icing and glaze over them would be enhanced perfection.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This may as well been your own art form. This was a fact that you owned, gosh darn it. It was something no one could take away from you, and the result was something your tastebuds would bask in later. Next on your list was lunch.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Typically, you would go with a sandwich, a bag of chips, apples or celery with peanut butter, and maybe a bit of chocolate to help encourage you halfway through the day. Chocolate was still a must-have, it always was. But maybe you'd put in a little extra effort for yourself while time allowed for it. It had been a while since you'd last had pasta. Even thinking about it now had your stomach grumbling in an appreciative response. You had grown to identify garlic bread with pasta, so that was a natural follow-up as well. You decided the final part would be a pocket salad, complete with whatever bits of dressing you could find.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It was amazing how good of a mood you were in. Lately you had been irritable, mainly towards yourself, and begrudgingly went about your daily routines. This was a nice and refreshing pace. You could tell that today was destined to be a good day.</p>
