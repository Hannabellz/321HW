    <body onload="music();">
        <p>Ever since you were a junior in high school, you started to have a newfound appreciation for music. You had always liked it before, but it became a portal to a new realm around that time. When you were younger, you often heard how much time junior year took up. There was so...much...work. When you got around to it for yourself, you found everyone else to be very correct.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was so much going on, and it was so easy to get caught up in it all. Taking breaks was a necessity, but trying to find time for them proved more difficult than you would have liked. Especially to play games that would've robbed you of more than you had. It had been during a weekend where you had a couple of papers to write. You had just gotten through the general structure and introduction of one.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Concentration had been playing lightly through your headphones, helping to block out the various distractions that threatened to wreck your train of thought. Rather than closing out of the app, you had the thought to turn it to your personal playlist. This would be one of the best decisions you made during your high school years.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You got up from your chair and tucked your phone into your pocket, moving around to the beat. There wasn't anything organized about it, nor did you really think to call it dancing, but it was free movement. Your thoughts were released from the confines of an English paper and went into unexplored areas of your mind. And it was amazing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Every so often you would partake in doing something similar, regardless of how much you may or may not have grown since then. It was such a simple way to escape from a moment of too much, and it was relatively easy to set a time to stick to returning to what you had been doing before.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Even if you needed to get out of your own head temporarily, this was the quick solution. So you grabbed your headphones and plugged them into your phone. Putting them so they fit comfortably in your ears, you navigated to one of your more upbeat playlists. If for nothing else, to completely let loose and have your spirits be lifted, even if it was temporarily.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was no pressure to look at the time or to count the number of songs for a while. You went somewhere else entirely, perhaps even to a different plane of existence. Your only true concern was tripping over a piece of furniture, and so that was the only thing you were mindful of. The actual movements it took to avoid that were not calculated, nor were they smooth, nor were they rigid. They just...were.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At some points, you would spin. Others you would jump, or just walk, or slide, or do some "fancy" movement with your arms. You grinned like a fool just as much as you made other funny faces that no one could see. But you could feel them, and it made you laugh despite yourself. Right now, you were existing for the sake of existing, and it served to do exactly as you wished for it to.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>By time you thought to look down at your phone again, <a href="ThirdAwake.html" class = "choice">it was nearly 4:30.</a></p>
