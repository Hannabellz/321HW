        <p>This had been a long-term goal since the minute you got this puzzle for yourself on a whim. It was a peculiar purchase, come to think of it. You couldn't remember when you last had done or completed a puzzle, much less one that was this large of a scale. It lay in wait on a table in the side room. You had left off at completing the full border, and doing some sorting based on the general color of the other pieces.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You flipped the light on and pulled up a chair, even though you knew you'd likely be standing most of the time. Puzzle solving entailed a fair amount of moving around, in part due to trying to decide what section you wanted to work on where. There was a part that had beautiful sunset colors, and you decided that would be your focus for the time being. Taking position at the respective end of the table, you started to attempt placing pieces together.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>From what you could understand about yourself, the colors were the main reasoning behind your selection of this puzzle. It was a painted, clear sky that was a beautiful depiction of the in-between. When day met night to exchange hands and positions. The light of the sun lingered, but other stars were starting to peek out in earnest. The grass below was influenced by unseen wind, similarly to the trees that were slightly tilted. There was even one branch that was definitely drawn to wave at you, and it did its job in being friendly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You could see this as something someone saw when looking out their window, and being breathtaken and inspired by it. Even in the puzzle of a painting, you were caught in the hope and magnificence it emitted. Despite not having such a view to revel in when evening came to its end, you yearned to be somewhere that did someday. Even if it took a while- a sight such as this would be worth it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For now, you'd admire it from afar, from your current home in the early hours of the morning. You would have a hand in piecing it together, which was an amazing note of itself. You became a creator of sorts, a piece in bringing the puzzle pieces together. Every time something fit perfectly and aligned to be one step closer to completion, there was a small burst of excitement. All it took was one, but more would certainly follow.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When you got into the zone, it was easy to stay in it. Nothing to distract you or pull you away. You could talk to the puzzle, and it would listen, just as you had listened when it called out to you at the store.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>How remarkable it was to already hear your alarm going off from your room. <a href="Awake For Work.html" class = "choice">It was time to get ready for work!</a></p>
