        <p>The last time you were not only able to sleep, but to fall back asleep after waking, was so long ago. You couldn't say definitively when it was, or when the next time such an opportunity would strike would be. Of course you'd seize this while you could. No matter how bizarre the dreams were.</p>

        <p>Instead of light or dark, the first thing that registered was water. All around you, there were molecules dancing in H20 bubbles that spelt out the liquid that encompassed you. When you breathed, some of the Os swept away in their current, disappearing into your nose. Carbon molecules were dispelled from you in every breath out, accompanied by double the oxygen you had inhaled. You supposed you were meant to be drowning...but you weren't.</p>
