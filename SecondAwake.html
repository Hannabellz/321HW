        <p>Selecting what you wanted to do now was difficult. Moving forward always required at least a step, and making decisions on what you could do at this time of morning proved challenging regardless of the amount of sleep you got.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To give yourself more time to decide, you started walking around the room. It wasn't quite pacing, although it could've been seen as grounding. A way to come back to the part of Earth you inhabited that kept your heart pumping. You wanted to keep yourself engaged, but you also needed something to distract yourself.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Because on one hand, your mind drifted every so often to looking up the meaningfulness of dreams. Was there real meaning behind them? Was there always meaning behind them? How could you tell? But this was already a rabbit hole in the making. One that would certainly send you spiraling into a place where you had a feeling you'd have trouble sleeping all over again. And was tonight worth that?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Certainly not. As weird as you currently thought your mind was, it didn't mean you had to think it was something to worry about too. Dreams were meant to be a bit strange, weren't they?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>...You had to find something to do. Fast.</p>
