    <h1>You have been deemed worthy of seeing something presently unfinished.</h1>
    <h2>Beware, things are not as they seem. Or perhaps...they're even more of what they seem than you perceive.</h2>
    <p>
        You’ve been having trouble sleeping, recently. Whenever you manage to surrender yourself to a soft slumber, you are viciously jarred awake. You never remember the cause. You would presume it to be a nightmare, but all you can recall is darkness.
You may as well have just closed your eyes for two seconds and reopened them again. 
It somehow makes you even more tired and irritable. It had been enough; you had suffered through enough. You would give it one more go tonight at 8 because all you wanted to do was crash. If it was another sleepless night, you would call up someone to drive you to the doctor. You definitely shouldn’t be driving with your current condition.
You stayed away from technology for the hour leading up to sleep, warm (and noncaffeinated) drink in hand. At this point, you’d try any home remedy. It wasn’t that you were scared of the doctor…although perhaps you were intimidated by the idea of not knowing what they could say.

    <p>
        Regardless, you had to take care of yourself. Even if that meant getting some help to do so.
Before you knew it, the clock on your wall read 8:00, and you had no problem getting into a comfortable position on your bed. Your pillow was nice, fluffed, and cool. The temperature was perfect to not be dying under the covers. You felt your eyes grow heavier and heavier…
    </p>
    <p>
        A shroud of darkness swept away<span class="highlight"> to reveal a blinding light.</span> It veered straight towards you and through you, making your insides flutter and pound. You felt no pain, but you did feel sick and overwhelmed. You were shaken by what you assumed to be a train paying absolutely no heed nor remorse to your well-being. You were left cold and alone.
    </p>
