    You've been having trouble sleeping, recently. Whenever you manage to surrender yourself to a soft slumber, you are viciously jarred awake. You never remember the cause. You would presume it to be a nightmare, but all you can recall is darkness.

    <p> You may as well have just closed your eyes for two seconds and reopened them again. 
    It somehow makes you even more tired and irritable. It had been enough; you had suffered through enough. You would give it one more go tonight at 8 because all you wanted to do was crash. If it was another sleepless night, you would call up someone to drive you to the doctor. You definitely shouldn't be driving with your current condition.

    <p></p>
    <p>Regardless, you had to take care of yourself. Even if that meant getting some help to do so.

    <p>Before you knew it, the clock on your wall read 8:00, and you had no problem getting into a comfortable position on your bed. Your pillow was nice, fluffed, and cool. The temperature was perfect to not be dying under the covers. <a href="First Dream.html">You felt your eyes grow heavier and heavier…</a>
