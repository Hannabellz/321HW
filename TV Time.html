        <p>You were with your own company...and that included your latest pick from Netflix! After days of seeking for a new show of interest (to help you in your long wait for new seasons of your other favorites to come out), you had managed to find an answer.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It was one of those crime shows, but it wasn't nearly as predictable. To be fair, that could've been in part to the fantasy elements that added a few tons of layers. It's hard to say who's what and who did what when there were little to no limitations. From what you could tell, anything was fair game at any point. But when it got around to the end of an episode, their succinct reasoning and the way they wrapped it up made so much sense. Their conclusions were irrefutable!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It was great that you never knew what was coming next. AND it was immersive- like you could easily be a part of this world with supernatural beings. You had finally gotten to the first episode that introduced one of the big-bads last time you watched. These were the ones to last past a single episode, sometimes past a single season, and come back in ways that either made you gasp or had your jaw drop.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You hoped that within these next two episodes you'd view this morning there would be more information. Would it be the one they located and started interviewing, or was there another culprit behind the scenes, pulling the strings and the investigators in every direction?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>With a blanket wrapped around you and a lamp on in the far corner in hopes of keeping you from getting too afraid, you opened your laptop and navigated to clicking play.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Even the start was baffling. Rather than picking up amidst the questioning, the perpetrator that had been caught wasn't in the room at all. Nor were the pair that had been trying to dish out the wanted answers. It had been two in-the-field agents, one a shapeshifter named Rain, and the other a human named Vince. There hadn't been an answer to what the culprit was yet, but they were some sort of impressive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Evalyn, who was quite good with technology, had been the only one on the other side of the one-way glass to have seen what happened. According to her, one moment things were as normal as they could get. The next thing she knew, objects were freezing. The hands of the clock came to a still, and even the timing on the cameras stilled. Smoke filled the room, wrapping around the three before everything disappeared with a pop.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>And that was it. The physical constructs of time continued after that point. Oddly enough, the cameras had managed to capture the escape too. When everyone else from the team was trying to go through for any tell-tale signs...there was nothing. Nothing that any of them could be sure about with their current experience, at least.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But that didn't mean it was over. Far from it. The werewolves would be sent out for any trace that they could find. The rest would do research to try to find anything about smoke and popping. Even if it was something outlandish from the Internet, it was better than lying in wait.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Every so often there would be a change in viewpoints. From the researchers, to the werewolves, and then somewhere else. Dark, unsettling, silent, and seemingly void of life. Whenever this scene was brought up, there were only small things going on. The small creak of a door in the distance, a light hum of some sort of motor or heater, unsteady tapping...There was never a person a part of these shots, but that may have been the worst part about it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Surely something must have been going on. Why would they be detailing it if it meant nothing? As the audience, you knew something had to result from this. But they weren't giving it away very easily.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>By the end of the first episode, the questions revolving around that room still hovered. The werewolves were coming up with nothing, and the rest of the team had compiled a list of possibilities. Their three prime suspects as to what went down?</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>There was a Demon Knight that was among the more fearsome of Hell's Creatures. This would have been strange considering there had never been one caught in their meddling before...</li>
            <li>A rogue genie had managed escape from their personal lamp and thus had nothing tying them down.</li>
            <li>One of the members of the Royal Guard, which was a set of trained magic users each with a specialty.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p>You didn't even reach for your mouse, allowing for it to continue quickly to the next episode. Much to your despair, but not so much to your surprise, there was a different problem that was the main focus of investigation for the episode. Crime didn't stop for no one, and it certainly didn't stop just because there was another big thing happening in the background. Luckily though, there were still a few scenes where Evalyn could be seen looking for more evidence towards any demon, genie, or magical someone being anywhere in-state.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You were left in complete awe when they caught the one responsible for numerous kidnappings. Not because it was a fairy, but because among her answers was the final line of the episode, and the one that you wanted answered more than anything.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Don't you want to find out where your two missing agents were taken, and why?"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was another shot of that empty room before the credits started to play. <a href="Third Awake.html" class = "choice">It was now 4:24, and you knew you'd be too intrigued after another episode to go to work.</a></p>
