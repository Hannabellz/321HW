        <p>You figured it would make sense to shower, now. It would give your hair time to dry on its own so you weren't left freezing at the times you'd have to be outside. It would give you time to breathe and to wake up to the fullest extent. Prior to now, showering had been your only hope for making it through a workday. Now, it would be but a supporting acquaintance.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p id="mealCheck">That was nice. And you would be just as grateful. Taking things for granted was one of the last things on your mind, recently. So, when you went into the bathroom to get ready, you gave the showerhead a light high five. If you hadn't been doing it for so long already, it probably would have made you feel a bit silly. But now, it was a part of the routine, and you saw it as just another way the shower encouraged you.</p>

        <p>All set and freshened up, you went to make sure your laptop had been charging all night. You unplugged it and tucked it into its case, along with the files you had been working on in preparation for today. You and the team you were a part of had been working towards a presentation for later this week, and you refused to be someone who didn't carry their weight. It was actually really nice to casually work on it.</p>
